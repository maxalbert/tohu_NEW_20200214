A primitive generator is simply a random generator which knows how to produce values of a specific \"type\" (in a slightly loose sense of the word). For example, there are primitive generators which produce random integers, random boolean values, random names, etc. (see here for a full list). The reason they are called \"primitive\" is because they do not depend on any other generators in tohu , and they can be combined into more complex generators (see subsequent sections). This section illustrates how to create and use primitive generators directly. Note that in practical use you will rarely need or want to create them manually as we do here - typically, they will be created as part of a CustomGenerator (TODO: see section [...]). However, it is useful to get a feel for how they work under the hood, so let's look at an example. Example: using Integer to produce random integers \u00b6 For our first example, let's use the Integer generator, which produces random integers in a given range. Here is the full code snippet and its output (we will look at this line by line in the next section). from tohu.primitive_generators import Integer # Create an instance of an Integer generator g = Integer ( 100 , 200 ) g . reset ( seed = 12345 ) # Produce a single value print ( next ( g )) # Produce a few more values manually for _ in range ( 3 ): print ( next ( g )) # Produce a sequence of values #g.generate(num=10, seed=12345) 153 193 101 138 Analysing the example \u00b6 Creating the Integer generator \u00b6 First we create an Integer generator that will produce values between 100 and 200. g = Integer ( 100 , 200 ) Resetting the generator \u00b6 Before we actually make it produce any values, we first reset the generator. The purpose of this is to initialize the internal (pseudo-)random number generator so that the output is reproducible. The seed argument which we pass to the reset method can have any value. As long as you pass the same seed the generator will produce the same sequence of output values, which ensures reproducibility. g . reset ( seed = 12345 ) <Integer: low=100, high=200> Producing individual random values \u00b6 Now that we have a primitive generator in a well-defined state, how can we produce values using this generator? One way of doing this is to call next() on it, which will ask g to produce a single new value for us. print ( next ( g )) 153 We can do this as many times as we want, and each time g will produce a new random integer in the range [100, 200] . Let's get five more. for _ in range ( 5 ): print ( next ( g )) 193 101 138 147 124 Producing a sequence of random values \u00b6 While this works ok, it quickly becomes cumbersome if we need a lot of values. A more convenient way is to call the generate method. We can pass the number of elements we want, as well as (optionally) a seed. If the seed is given, this internally calls reset , which ensures that the returned sequence is reproducible (see above). #g.generate(num=20, seed=99999) TODO: Implement the .generate() method and explain that the return value is a Python generator (not a list).","title":"The Basic Building Blocks: Primitive Generators"},{"location":"tutorials/the_basic_building_blocks_primitive_generators/#the-basic-building-blocks-primitive-generators","text":"","title":"The Basic Building Blocks: Primitive Generators"},{"location":"tutorials/the_basic_building_blocks_primitive_generators/#introduction","text":"The most fundamental building blocks of tohu are the so-called \"primitive\" generators.
